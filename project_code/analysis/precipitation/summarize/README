The scripts in this directory should only be run after running those in the mcmc/ directory.

chi_u/ 
	- calculate empirical and model based estimates of chi_u for the annual maximum precip data (figure 5)
mcmc_post_proc/
	- calculate log-scores
	- make posterior predictive draws that are used for 
		1. QQ plots (figure 6)
		2. Quantile surface estimates (figure 7)
		3. Posterior predictive mean (figure 8)
		4. Factor analysis (figure 9)
