The code in all of the sub-directories below is used to initialize and run mcmcs for the four models described in the paper. These should all be run before running combine_mcmc_output.R, which can be used to combine mcmc samples that were stored in smaller data chunks.

The naming convention for nested folders is as follows:

fixed: Gaussian density basis model
lnorm: log-Gaussian process basis model

maxid: theta > 0 case
maxstable: theta = 0 case (note that maxstable models are max-id)


fixed/
	maxid/
	maxstable/

lnorm/
	maxid/
	maxstable/
